In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene. 	Second Person thought Ciceri's backdrop for Act I was ``not so good ... it is all weak and pale'' but he liked the set for Act II: ``(Ciceri's) second act is a delight, a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees at the end of the piece, and very magical in its effect.''

620	30620	30621	The appeals court said that Whitman had based her information on contradictory information and statements from President First Person.

Second Person of Variety called A Field in England ``a defiantly unclassifiable cross-genre experiment... that simultaneously reinvents and regurgitates low-budget British cinema as it goes''. 	Third Person said of the director's approach, ``Clearly, Fourth Person is bored with the paint-by-numbers approach of his horror contemporaries, but has swung so far in the opposite direction here, the result feels almost amateurishly avant garde at times, guilty of the sort of indulgences one barely tolerates in student films.''

623	30623	30624	Nonetheless, the problems began when the leaders could not agree where the center of power of this union would be located. Many of the leaders would soon figure that this union would not happen, and many (such as 	Jos* de San Mart*n) went back to their regular lives in disappointment. Yet, in order to expand his personal dream of Gran Colombia, Bol*var allowed Sucre to form the nation of Bolivia in Upper Peru.

First Person goes on in defence of her as a gifted but sometimes understandably misguided example of women's writing. It is evident that 	Woolf sympathises deeply with Finch's plight as a female poet, and though she takes issue with some of the content in Finch's writing, she expresses grief that Finch is so unknown: ``...when one comes to seek out the facts about Second Person, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about her.''
629	30629	30630	While his back-up vocalists Gloria Jones and First Person are without doubt talented singers, their place in the plan is strange: the way they're used is just years out of date.''

634	30634	30635	Note that different sources use different sequence numbers for some of the Counts. For consistency across sources, dates of birth and death are useful.

Third Person is very strong guy!''

In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene. Second Person thought 	Ciceri's backdrop for Act I was ``not so good ... it is all weak and pale'' but he liked the set for Act II: ``(Ciceri's) second act is a delight, a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees at the end of the piece, and very magical in its effect.''
2617	32617	32618	Instead of returning to her tomb at the end of the ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth.

2620	32620	32621	The appeals court said that Whitman had based her information on contradictory information and statements from President First Person.

Third Person said of the director's approach, ``Clearly, 	Fourth Person is bored with the paint-by-numbers approach of his horror contemporaries, but has swung so far in the opposite direction here, the result feels almost amateurishly avant garde at times, guilty of the sort of indulgences one barely tolerates in student films.''

First Person goes on in defence of her as a gifted but sometimes understandably misguided example of women's writing. It is evident that Woolf sympathises deeply with 	Finch's plight as a female poet, and though she takes issue with some of the content in Finch's writing, she expresses grief that Finch is so unknown: ``...when one comes to seek out the facts about Second Person, one finds, as usual, that almost nothing is known about her.''
